N|Solid OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Guide
DRAFT 08/01/2025
Introduction
This is a guide for implementing custom OpenTelemetry trace and metric instrumentation into your team’s N|Solid projects. N|Solid provides trace spans and metrics natively for HTTP and DNS requests, for many projects that may be all that is necessary. For those looking for more in-depth information on their applications, N|Solid provides a route for easy custom Otel instrumentation that can send data directly to the N|Solid console. Rather than performing traditional Otel instrumentation with endpoints such as Grafana|Tempo, N|Solid users have the opportunity to keep all of their necessary diagnostic information in a single centralized suite.
Setup Requirements
* N|Solid runtime installed
* N|Solid SaaS connected
* Environment variable NSOLID_TRACING_ENABLED=1 for all desired processes
* Latest stable release of your desired OpenTelemetry instrumentation configured in package.json (e.g. @opentelemetry/instrumentation-ioredis, @opentelemetry/instrumentation-mongodb, etc.)
* Latest stable release of @opentelemetry/api configured in package.json
Implementation
For this example, we will set up mongodb instrumentation in a node application
1. Set instrumentation requirements for the desired module(s) before establishing other methods or requirements
// -- Otel Instrumentation  provides spans for worker management--
const nsolid = require('nsolid')
const { MongoDBInstrumentation } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation-mongodb')
const api = require('@opentelemetry/api')


2. Register the OpenTelemetry api with nsolid
if (!nsolid.otel.register(api)){
  throw new Error('Failed to register NSOLID OpenTelemetry')
}
3. Register the desired instrumentation with the N|Solid native implementation of OpenTelemetry instrumentation
nsolid.otel.registerInstrumentations([
  new MongoDBInstrumentation()
])


4. For custom implementation, users can implement custom hooks and options as specified by the original instrument’s documentation in the OpenTelemetry documentation - @opentelemetry/instrumentation-mongodb - npm


After performing this implementation and rebuilding your program, you can gain visibility into your MongoDB traces, etc. in the N|Solid console’s ‘traces’ menu. Some programs may require more detailed tooling with set hooks and added api context
